# Frontend Developer Home Assignment

You are tasked to create a user interface for a testing system and microservices health.

> The application fetches a collection of tests from the backend and performs calls to the backend API to execute the individual tests.

The collection of tests should be fetched with GET request from the following URL:<br>
`http://localhost:8001/api/v1/tests`

Individual tests from the collection are executed with POST requests.

You can test the API response from the console, for example:<br>
`curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/api/v1/tests/system/check-info`
<br>
`{"result": "true"} `

The API is expected to respond with standard HTTP status codes.

**Please create a UI in React that runs and displays the tests.**

The UI should have two pages:

1. The main page with the list of tests
2. A page with the history of test runs (you can store the test results in localstorage)

#### Additional requirements:

- Hooks should be used where suitable
- A CSS framework of your choice may be used to style the components, for example Tailwind
- We expect to the components to have unit tests

We will accept a zip archive with the entire `tigerlab-react-interview` folder (do not include node_modules).<br>
Good luck!
